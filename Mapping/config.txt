# Configuration file  for the quantitative transcriptome analysis pipeline.
#
# Precisions about the sample file:
#
# The sample file is a text file containing one sample per line.
# In case the experiment is a paired end, each sample must be written this way:
#
#       conditions  conditions_rep  path_to_left_read   path_to_right_read
#
# Each part must be separated by tabulation (or spaces).
# Left read correspond to the read "1" and the right read to the read "2"
# The file must not contain empty lines!!
# For single end, the 4th column remain empty.
